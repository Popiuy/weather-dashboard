## Description 

In this project I used an api to pull and parse through information I wanted to append to the page. I used current for the most applicable information on today. I used the forecast api to grab the next 5 days of information. When we searched for a city the page would make a button for that city and append the current weather data and dates for that city and the next 5 days and. The city is appended to the search history in local storage. When we view current weather conditions from a city we are presented with an icon with temperature, wind speed, and humidity. The next 5 days are then presented with the additional values. The user then can press any recently searched cities to toggle between them. If the user presses the search button without adding any information it will alert with "please enter a city".
